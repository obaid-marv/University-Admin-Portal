                    <p>COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI) started its journey in 1998, and established its first campus at Islamabad in April 1998. In August 2000, in recognition of CUI's achievements, the Federal Government granted it the status of a Degree Awarding Institute (DAI) through promulgation of its charter.</p>

                    <p>I feel honored to lead the COMSATS University Islamabad (CUI) as Rector and share with you my vision for CUI, which has always been an innovative institution of learning and development. Our focus in the coming years will be to transform CUI to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing technological environment as well as societal needs through the best affordable academic programs at par with leading global standards, within Pakistan. In short, we envision making CUI "the University of Choice" in Pakistan and across Asia. Although an ambitious vision, but I believe that the talent, skill and experience available at CUI will enable us to achieve success with dedication and hard work.</p>
